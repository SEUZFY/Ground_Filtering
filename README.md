CSF algorithm is based on the cloth simulation with verlet integration.

The idea of CSF is from this paper:

The basic architectures and ideas are inspired by this article (its related code is open source).

The tin refinement algorithm is from my collaborator Yitong Xia(xiayitong0630@gmail.com), thank her for her efforts and dedications.
